NAME
    Crypt::AES::CTR - This is a port of Chris Veness' AES implementation.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    This module encrypts and decrypts AES strings using CTR and Chris
    Veness' AES implementation. It is compatible with PHP encrypting and
    decrypting.

        use Crypt::AES::CTR;
    
        my $plaintext 'string';
        my $ciphertext = Crypt::AES::CTR::encrypt($plaintext,'password',256);
        $plaintext = Crypt::AES::CTR::decrypt($ciphertext,'password',256);

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  encrypt($plaintext, $key, $nbits)
     Encrypt a text using AES encryption in Counter mode of operation
 
     Unicode multi-byte character safe
 
     $plaintext - plaintext Source text to be encrypted
     $key - The password to use to generate a key
     $nbits - Number of bits to be used in the key (128, 192, or 256)
 
     returns encrypted text string

  decrypt($ciphertext, $key, $nbits)
     Decrypt a text encrypted by AES in counter mode of operation
 
     $ciphertext - Source text to be decrypted
     $key - The password to use to generate a key
     $nbits - Number of bits to be used in the key (128, 192, or 256)
 
     returns decrypted text
